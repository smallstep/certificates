type Conn interface {
	// Read reads data from the connection.
	// Read can be made to time out and return an Error with Timeout() == true

	// Write writes data to the connection.
	// Write can be made to time out and return an Error with Timeout() == true

	// Close closes the connection.

	Close() error

	// LocalAddr returns the local network address.
	LocalAddr() Addr

	// RemoteAddr returns the remote network address.
	RemoteAddr() Addr

	// SetDeadline sets the read and write deadlines associated
	// with the connection. It is equivalent to calling both
	// SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline.
	//
	// A deadline is an absolute time after which I/O operations
	// fail with a timeout (see type Error) instead of
	// blocking. The deadline applies to all future and pending
	// I/O, not just the immediately following call to Read or
	// Write. After a deadline has been exceeded, the connection
	// can be refreshed by setting a deadline in the future.
	//
	// An idle timeout can be implemented by repeatedly extending
	// the deadline after successful Read or Write calls.
	//
	// A zero value for t means I/O operations will not time out.
	//
	// Note that if a TCP connection has keep-alive turned on,
	// which is the default unless overridden by Dialer.KeepAlive
	// or ListenConfig.KeepAlive, then a keep-alive failure may
	// also return a timeout error. On Unix systems a keep-alive
	// failure on I/O can be detected using
	// errors.Is(err, syscall.ETIMEDOUT).
	SetDeadline(t time.Time) error

	// SetReadDeadline sets the deadline for future Read calls
	// and any currently-blocked Read call.
	// A zero value for t means Read will not time out.
	SetReadDeadline(t time.Time) error

	// SetWriteDeadline sets the deadline for future Write calls
	// and any currently-blocked Write call.
	// Even if write times out, it may return n > 0, indicating that
	// some of the data was successfully written.
	// A zero value for t means Write will not time out.
	SetWriteDeadline(t time.Time) error
